Summary:
Finding the variability is simply a matter of finding which measures have the highest variance across hospitals. It is important to scale measures before comparing them.

Methodology:
To find which procedures have the most variability across hospitals its important to show the measures on the same scale. If I were simply to calculate the variance, those measures which are on a scale from 0-1 would have a much lower variance than those on a scale from 0-100. Therefore, I start by scaling the measures and then computing the variance. I validate by including the mean and standard deviation for each procedure.

- Scale the procedure scores to an adjusted score by dividing each score by the average
- Find the variance across all providers for each procedure and sort from largest to smallest
- For context, include the average score as well as the standard deviation for each procedure

Findings:
The 10 procedures below all had the highest variability across all providers. The procedure VTE_6 corresponds to the % of patients who did not get treatment that could have prevented a blood clot. This has the highest variance as many providers reported 0, but some reported very high values. Nearly all the procedures in the table below have a standard deviation that is higher than their average score which could indicate heavy skew in each of the metrics.
